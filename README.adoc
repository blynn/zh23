= ZuriHac 2023 =

This is a fork of https://github.com/blynn/compiler that I presented at
ZuriHac 2023.

I added the slides and the combinator interpreter visualization thing.

To build them, install `clang` and `lld`, then:

  $ make doh.wasm
  $ ./stitch slide sly.txt
  $ ./stitch slide bubble.txt

When I gave my talk, I served the directory locally using my tool
https://github.com/blynn/toservemanpages
and pointed my browser to http://localhost:3000/sly.html and
http://localhost:3000/bubble.html.
